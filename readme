## Project Description
This project aims to develop a program that utilizes artificial intelligence to predict the most financially lucrative products for a given store in our database. The program's primary objective is to assist in identifying products that generate substantial revenue. Additionally, it focuses on addressing the challenge of accurately estimating the relevance of newly introduced products.

## Features
- Predicting high-revenue generating products for each store based on historical sales data.
- Incorporating artificial intelligence techniques to handle the complexity of estimating the relevance of newly introduced products.
- Providing recommendations that can be applied to all stores and products in our database.

## Installation

You need wsl: Ubuntu
Open the project folder in your working environment (in VS Code)
Navigate to the project directory using the cd command

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Modify the relative path if necessary

## Usage

Open the recommendation_algorithm.py file and modify the following variables according to your requirements:

- directory_path: Path to the directory containing the data files.
- selected_date: Month number for which the algorithm will make predictions.
- show_all: Set to True to display all recommendations per store, or False to display only the top recommendation.
